## Calculation of BAC

The calculation of the BAC can be done using the Widmark's formula.

### Rate of absorption

Multiple factors influence the rate of absorption:

- sex
- height
- weight
- body composition
- age
- the concentration of the alcoholic beverage (important: stronger alcohols lead to higher BAC!)
- the total amount of alcohol ingested
- the rate of ingestion
- the fed or fasted state
  - the nature and composition of food
- genetic factors
  - ADH enzyme

### Rate of elimination

Alcohol elimination rates also vary widely, due to differences in the metabolising enzymes, as well as environmental factors. 
These combined differences result in a 3-4 fold variance in the alcohol elimination rate. 

The factors influencing alcohol eliminiation include:

- Food (independent of the food composition)
- Genetic variation

Factors that don't influence alcohol elimination rates are:

- Gender
- Age (probably, since other factors like body composition that correlate with age are more important)
- Regularity of alcohol consumption
  - Even though this changes the availability of some of the enzymes and the size of the liver, the overall effect can be neglected 

## Drinks

The drinks that can be added in the app are separated in three categories:

- Popular generic drinks: Generic representations of typical beverages, can be added without searching. 
- Other generic drinks: Generic representations of beverages that are not so popular, can be added by searching for them
- Cocktails: Drinks that represent mixtures of the two previous categories. Can be added by searching
