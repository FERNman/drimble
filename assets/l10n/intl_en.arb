The estimate is based on the amount of alcohol consumed, the time of consumption, and the amount of water in your body. To estimate those values, the formula takes gender, weight, height, and age into account. In addition, the formula assumes an average metabolism of up to 20mg/100ml (depending on the BAC) per hour.",

  "faq_doesTheEstimatedBACCorrespondToTheActualBACText": "No! Even though the formula used is a scientifically proven method, the estimated blood alcohol level is only an approximation. The actual blood alcohol level depends on many factors, such as the individual metabolism, the amount of food consumed, the type of alcohol consumed, etc. The estimated blood alcohol level is therefore only an approximation and should not be used as a basis for decisions that could endanger life and limb.",
