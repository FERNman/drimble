# DrinkAware

## Goals

- Help people learn about their alcohol usage
- Reduce alcohol-related health issues, both direct and indirect
- Encourage drinking less alcohol overall

## Version 1

- Should allow tracking alcohol consumption with very little clicks (optimally just one)
- Should allow calculating your BAC 
- Should provide information about the health implications of the amount of alcohol consumed (e.g. total units of alcohol)
- Should warn about driving at the current level of intoxication
- Should inform about the amount of calories consumed
- It should be possible to see how much of an increase the consumption of another portion would have

### How adding a beverage should work

- On the home screen, display the last 3 beverages with the option to add more
- Searching beverages should allow for generic versions

## Future ideas

- Push notifications
  - Motivation
  - Reminders
- Planning your drinking ahead of time
- Specific versions of beverages instead of generics
- Set goals on how much alcohol you want to trink per week and in one session as well as how many sober days per week

## Notes

### Factors relevant for BAC calculations
  - Amount of alcohol
  - Percentage of alcohol (more = more BAC)
  - Dilution of alcohol (more water = less BAC)
  - Speed of digestion (more food prior to alcohol consumption = less BAC)
  - Age, Sex, Weight, Body Composition
